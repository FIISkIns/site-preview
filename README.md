Contributors: Gafitescu Petru-Marian, Pomohaci Alexandru, Popescu Georgian Sefan, Seniuc Bogdan

FIISkIns is a modular web app intended to be used a virtual instructor. FIISkIns will provide valuable resources structured as tasks. Each area of interest will have its own course, with different levels of difficulty: beginner, intermediate and advanced, each level having a number of tasks available. Visitors will be able to see the courses' description (available in the Learn page). After registration or login, an user will have the possibility of enrolling in a course. All courses will be displayed in the Course dropdown of the navigation bar.
After choosing a course, a corresponding page will show, displaying the current taks and the list of all tasks in the course.
Each course will be implemented by an independent Web microservice. 
Each user will have a profile page, divided in two sections: statistics and achievements.

FIISkIns/site-preview is a repository created for showcasing the front-end of the application. For this part we chose three courses: Origami, Self-Defence and Survival. All the pages are currently just templates:
the Learn page shows how the courses' description will be organized, the Profile page features a fictional user and the Course page highlights how the information will fit in page.
